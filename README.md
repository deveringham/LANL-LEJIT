Workflow for scientific computing (collection, generation and processing of numerical data) is defined as â€œsequencing and orchestrating operations, along with the attendant tasks related to these operations." The specification of input data, control flow and output data is critical to many aspects of the scientific workflow.  In addition, how the application is configured, compiled, linked and run is also part of the workflow.  We will call these workflow aspects the "control and configuration workflow."  This project concerns researching and prototyping novel mechanisms for control and configuration workflows for new scientific application codes currently being developed as part of the NGC project.


For information about the usage and implemenation of LEJIT (Lua Easy Just In Time library), check Readme.md in the LEJIT directory. 


Check out the performancetest.* files in the performance directory for LEJIT performance benchmarks you can run yourself, and the plots directory within performance to see previous results.


Also be sure to read Readme.md in the vpic directory to learn about integrating LEJIT with VPIC.
