Input deck

Lua — small interpreter, Cleaner to interface w C or Fortran. Threading, JIT story cleaner.

Python — too many packages — maybe pure python or shared objects fortran, many tasks asking for same module, LIvermore. Sandia had micro kernels that didn’t support shared objects. Makes for fragile system. Andre Gertik, CCS-2, Chris Malone XCP-1.

Get familiar with Lua capabilities, understand C and Fortran interfaces.

Can put workbook on top of interpreters. Machine learning lib on top of Lua. WB provides w/ automatic provenance. Feed viz back into WB. Can it scale?
