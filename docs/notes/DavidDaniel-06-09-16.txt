NGC should fit into Common Model Framework (CMF) and In Gen tools. Mostly focusses on LaGrangian code.

Want to have compile time opt and run code independently as well.

Levels of dynamic control.

When past milestone in a couple months, will take prototypes and transition to real codes. Developing a plan for the next year. Next year deliver integrated toolkit.

RAGE being transitioned to cmake build system.

Talk to Lucy to gather information. Run efficiently on exascale-class systems — more complex config and compilation.

performance, flexibility, provenance

recompile based on particular problem or configuration.

Recompile mesh, different phases become important at different times. Thresholds when different physics packages turn on, so data structures may change. Phase w/o nuc rxns, then phase when do happen and need to keep track of isotopes. Recompile and use accessors after that.

AMR — may need to recompile, parameters for algorithm change.

Materials involved may change during sim. They move around. Could move from one to more. Could move from table-based EOS to analytical function.

In Situ.

Plan for in situ in context of FLECSI — simple app coupled with viz/catalyst scriptable. Writing out exodus files now. VISIT.
