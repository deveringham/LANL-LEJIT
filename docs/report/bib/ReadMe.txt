Please put all new bib entries into an appropriate file that is NOT
all.bib. 

all.bib is automatically built from all other bib files using the
make.sh shell script. Note that it requires 'bibtool' and 'emacs' in
your path. It merges different bibs together and removes duplicates.

If you add a bib entry, please rebuild all.bib and check it in at
the same time you check in your other bib changes.
