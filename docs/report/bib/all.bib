  abstract      = "With the onset of extreme-scale computing, I/O constraints
                  make it increasingly difficult for scientists to save a
                  sufficient amount of raw simulation data to persistent
                  storage. One potential solution is to change the data
                  analysis pipeline from a post-process centric to a
                  concurrent approach based on either in-situ or in-transit
                  processing. In this context computations are considered
                  in-situ if they utilize the primary compute resources,
                  while in-transit processing refers to offloading
                  computations to a set of secondary resources using
                  asynchronous data transfers. In this paper we explore the
                  design and implementation of three common analysis
                  techniques typically performed on large-scale scientific
                  simulations: topological analysis, descriptive statistics,
                  and visualization. We summarize algorithmic developments,
                  describe a resource scheduling system to coordinate the
                  execution of various analysis workflows, and discuss our
                  implementation using the DataSpaces and ADIOS frameworks
                  that support efficient data movement between in-situ and
                  in-transit computations. We demonstrate the efficiency of
                  our lightweight, flexible framework by deploying it on the
                  Jaguar XK6 to analyze data generated by S3D, a massively
                  parallel turbulent combustion code. Our framework allows
                  scientists dealing with the data deluge at extreme scale to
                  perform analyses at increased temporal resolutions,
                  mitigate I/O costs, and significantly improve the time to
                  insight.",

  abstract      = {The performance mismatch between computing and I/O
                  components of current-generation HPC systems has made I/O
                  the critical bottleneck for scientific applications. It is
                  therefore critical to make data movement as efficient as
                  possible, and, to facilitate simulation-time data analysis
                  and visualization to reduce the data written to storage.
                  These will be of paramount importance to enabling us to
                  glean novel insights from simulations. We present our work
                  in GLEAN, a flexible framework for data-analysis and I/O
                  acceleration at extreme scale. GLEAN leverages the data
                  semantics of applications, and fully exploits the diverse
                  system topologies and characteristics. We discuss the
                  performance of GLEAN for simulation-time analysis and I/O
                  acceleration with simulations at scale on leadership class
                  systems.},

  abstract      = {{Principal component analysis is central to the study of
                  multivariate data. Although one of the earliest
                  multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of
                  much research, ra nging from new model- based approaches to
                  algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely
                  versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first
                  edition of this book was the first comp rehensive text
                  written solely on principal component analysis. The second
                  edition updates and substantially expands the original
                  version, and is once again the definitive text on the
                  subject. It i ncludes core material, current research and a
                  wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double
                  that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in
                  other fields that use principal co mponent analysis, will
                  find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible
                  account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for
                  graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requi
                  res some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is
                  Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He
                  is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three
                  other books. His researc h interests are broad, but aspects
                  of principal component analysis have fascinated him and
                  kept him busy for over 30 years.}},
