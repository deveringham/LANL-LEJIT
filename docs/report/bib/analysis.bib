    abstract = {{Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ra
nging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comp
rehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It i
ncludes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal co
mponent analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requi
res some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His researc
h interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.}},

abstract={The performance mismatch between computing and I/O components of current-generation HPC systems has made I/O the critical bottleneck for scientific applications. It is therefore critical to make data movement as efficient as possible, and, to facilitate simulation-time data analysis and visualization to reduce the data written to storage. These will be of paramount importance to enabling us to glean novel insights from simulations. We present our work in GLEAN, a flexible framework for data-analysis and I/O acceleration at extreme scale. GLEAN leverages the data semantics of applications, and fully exploits the diverse system topologies and characteristics. We discuss the performance of GLEAN for simulation-time analysis and I/O acceleration with simulations at scale on leadership class systems.},

		 constraints make it increasingly difficult for
		 scientists to save a sufficient amount of raw
		 simulation data to persistent storage. One potential
		 solution is to change the data analysis pipeline from a
		 post-process centric to a concurrent approach based on
		 either in-situ or in-transit processing. In this
		 context computations are considered in-situ if they
		 utilize the primary compute resources, while in-transit
		 processing refers to offloading computations to a set
		 of secondary resources using asynchronous data
		 transfers. In this paper we explore the design and
		 implementation of three common analysis techniques
		 typically performed on large-scale scientific
		 simulations: topological analysis, descriptive
		 statistics, and visualization. We summarize algorithmic
		 developments, describe a resource scheduling system to
		 coordinate the execution of various analysis workflows,
		 and discuss our implementation using the DataSpaces and
		 ADIOS frameworks that support efficient data movement
		 between in-situ and in-transit computations. We
		 demonstrate the efficiency of our lightweight, flexible
		 framework by deploying it on the Jaguar XK6 to analyze
		 data generated by S3D, a massively parallel turbulent
		 combustion code. Our framework allows scientists
		 dealing with the data deluge at extreme scale to
		 perform analyses at increased temporal resolutions,
		 mitigate I/O costs, and significantly improve the time
		 to insight.",
